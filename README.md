Python code for my Infinitesimal Alexander Module project

This is the Python code that I used to prove that the Infinitesimal Alexander Module is a knot invariant.

It was written using Python 2.7, so some of the commands are outdated for later versions of Python.  In particular 
print "Hello World" 
is no longer valid syntax.
